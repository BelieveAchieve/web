# IMPORTANT
Make sure to fix the `FIXME`s in the code before using (or just use my branches as a guide to do however you want to organize things)

# Broad view
The app uses Cordova which serves up a basic index.html that iframes app.upchieve.org. The app has some Cordova plugins installed that can be called directly using Portal Gun.

Code here:
https://github.com/austinhallock/upchieve-native I can move this over to UPchieve's GitHub whenever.

# Portal Gun
Portal Gun (https://github.com/claydotio/portal-gun) is the communication layer between web and native (and eventually service workers whenever you add them)

A basic call looks something like `PortalService.call("statusBar.setBackgroundColor", {color: "#000000"})`

Portal Gun also accepts callbacks as the second param for certain methods like `app.onBack` if you want to do anything special when the native back button (Android) is tapped.

# Native iOS

# Native Android

# Web
## Detecting when web app is being run through native app
The native app's user agent has upchieve/v0.1.1/... so you can use that (also to get app version #)

## Routing from push notifications
Portal's `top.getData` has routing data when app is opened from cold start w/ notification. `top.onData` (callback) is called whenever app is opened from warm start (and also if app is open when push is received). If app is open, `_original.additionalData.foreground` will be true, and you can use some internal UI to show the notification

Those portal calls are also made when the user is routed into the app w/ a deep link if you guys do that (`_isDeepLink` will be true in that case)

This is roughly how I handle data from push notifications in FreeRoam (coffeescript, sorry).

```coffee
routeHandler = (data) ->
  data ?= {}
  {path, _isPush, _original, _isDeepLink} = data

  if _isPush and _original?.additionalData?.foreground
    if Environment.isIos() and Environment.isNativeApp()
      model.portal.call 'push.setBadgeNumber', {number: 0}

    currentNotification.next {
      title: _original?.additionalData?.title or _original.title
      message: _original?.additionalData?.message or _original.message
      type: _original?.additionalData?.type
      data: {path}
    }
  else if path?
    router.goPath path
```

## iOS-specific
Overall: iOS sucks. It's the new IE 6. Learn to hate Apple.

iOS scrolling on < iOS 13 is janky w/o `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, so it needs to be anywhere `overflow: auto` is

iOS tries to auto-expand iframes to their full-height, which makes scrolling generally suck. So we need to wrap all content in a div that's 100% wh & has overflow: auto. this is the only overflow: auto that shouldn't have `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`. I don't remember the exact bug, but my code comment linked to `http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9807620/ipad-safari-scrolling-causes-html-elements-to-disappear-and-reappear-with-a-dela`


iOS is annoying and doesn't blur focus from element when you tap on other stuff. Something like this will take care of that:
```coffee
onclick: if Environment.isIos()
  (e) ->
    focusTag = document.activeElement.tagName
    if focusTag in focusTags and not (e.target.tagName in focusTags)
      document.activeElement.blur()
```

# Server
https://github.com/UPchieve/server/compare/cordova-link for example of using FCM. That'll work for iOS, Android and web push.

You'll need to store push tokens for users. Should store in a way where users can have multiple push tokens.





install xcode if you don't have it https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
install cocoapods: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started
`pod setup`

git clone git@github.com:austinhallock/upchieve-native.git
cd upchieve-native
npm install
npm run local-ios
cd cordova
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@2.5.3
cd ../
npm run local-ios
it'll probably error saying something about missing ios-deploy.
if it errors about `'xcodebuild' requires xcode`, run:
```
xcode-select --install
sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

open xcode
file -> open (or it might just go straight to the 'welcome to xcode'... from there do 'open another project')
  -> find and open upchieve-native/platforms/ios/UPchieve.xworkspace

xcode->preferences. accounts tab. add icon (bottom left). on your upchieve account, verify that under teams is "Upchieve, Inc". close. (if it's not there, you need to be added as dev)

"general" tab. select team -> "Upchieve".





you may need some other global dependencies here like gulp and coffee. if you get errors, let me know
