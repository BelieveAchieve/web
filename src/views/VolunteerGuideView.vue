      <h2>Become an "Active" Coach</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you’ve created your account, you still need to set up your
        availability and pass at least one certification quiz before you can
        start receiving students requests. Read about how to complete each of
        these steps below. We’ve also included some quick tips on how to
        maximize your requests and impact.
      </p>

      <div>
        <accordion-item label="Scheduling Your Availability">
          <p>
            Go to the <router-link to="/calendar">Schedule</router-link> page
            and select all the times you’d like to receive notifications if a
            student requests help. We recommend you select times where you
            expect to be free at least 60% of the time. Don’t worry—you’re never
            committed to picking up a request because we text more than one
            volunteer at once.

                <strong>Want to get more requests?</strong> Students are most
                active on the platform from 4pm-12am ET on weekdays, so if you
                can select these times, do so!

            Go to the <router-link to="/training">Training</router-link> page
            and click “Take Test” to begin a certification quiz! If you’re
            familiar with the material, the average quiz is 10-15 questions and
            should take you about 15 minutes. We recommend you try the quiz once
            to get a baseline, then review our materials to fill in the gaps in
            your knowledge. You get 3 tries!

      <h2>Work With Students</h2>

      <p>
        After your account is “active”, you’ll start seeing texts from UPchieve
        about students that need your help! Below we’ve broken down every step
        of working with a student on UPchieve, including quick tips on how to
        have the biggest impact possible.
      </p>

      <div>
        <accordion-item label="Picking Up a Request">
          <p>
            If a student makes a request in a subject you’re certified in and at
            a time that you’ve opted in to notifications, you’ll get a text
            message from UPchieve. Our texts look like this:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              style="height: 100px; margin: 10px 0 20px;"
              src="~@/assets/example-text-notification.png"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            To fulfill a request, you can either click on the link in the text
            you received or select the student from the list of waiting students
            located on the <router-link to="/dashboard">dashboard</router-link>.
          </p>

          <div class="block-section">
            <p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Not sure how much time you have?</strong> No problem!
                The average session lasts 30 mins, so you should generally have
                at least 30 mins free when you pick up a request. But if you
                need to leave early, it’s ok! See the next section for tips on
                how to do that.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Not near a computer?</strong> No problem! Everything but
                the whiteboard works on mobile browsers, so you can start
                sessions on your phone and then switch over to your computer. As
                long as you don’t click “End Session”, there will be a button to
                rejoin your active session on the Dashboard!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Need a few minutes to get ready?</strong> No problem! If
                you know you can get to a computer or focus on the session
                within 3-5 minutes, you can generally still select the student
                and let them know you need a few minutes. A lot of students give
                up if they’re not paired with a coach within 5 minutes, so we
                encourage you to pick up requests and at least ask what you can
                help with to get things kicked off ASAP.
              </li>

        <accordion-item label="While In a Session">
          <p>
            After picking up a request, you’ll be placed in our virtual
            classroom. Right now, this classroom is equipped with a text-based
            chat and a whiteboard. It looks like this:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img

            It’s important to be friendly and encouraging! Here’s some easy

                problem up, but I highly encourage you to make another request
                if you still need more help! Another person should be able to
                help you.”

                on their homework!

        <accordion-item label="How to Be a Good Tutor">
          <p>
            Being a good tutor doesn’t mean you need to know everything about
            every subject. In fact, many of our best tutors start each session
            by Googling the topic in question to give themselves a refresher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, being a good tutor is all about identifying gaps in
            knowledge, leading the student to the answer themselves, and
            generalizing the approaches that you teach them so they can apply it
            to other problems.
          </p>

          <div class="block-section">
            <p>
              <strong>Here’s how a typical tutoring session might go:</strong>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Start with identifying the problem type.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    (“It seems like this is about solving a system of linear
                    equations. Is that what you covered in class today?”)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask them if they know the relevant definitions or formulas.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    (“This is the formula you use to find the area of a circle.
                    Does it look familiar to you?”)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask them if they know what the first (or second or third) step
                is.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If they do, have them complete it on the whiteboard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If they don’t, tell them, and ask them if they know how to
                    complete that step.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    (“So the first step is to calculate the degree of the
                    numerator. Do you know how to do that?)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Guide them through the problem step-by-step, explaining relevant
                concepts and trying to generalize where possible so they can
                solve similar problems.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    (“Anytime you need to find the asymptote, you will start by
                    comparing the degree of the numerator and denominator.
                    There’s only 3 possible cases / rules that you need to
                    memorize!”)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Stop them when they start to go wrong. Try to explain why what
                they did was wrong and ask them if it makes sense.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    (“Almost! There’s one more number that needs to be excluded
                    from the domain though because it leads to division by 0.”)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                At the end of the problem, ask a student if they know what the
                answer is now and check their final answer.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    “That’s correct, awesome job!”

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Can I give the student the answer?</strong>
                Try your best to lead the student to the answer instead. You can
                check answers (that is, tell them if it is right or wrong), but
                generally you should not give them the answer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How do I know what the student already knows?</strong>
                Check what they’ve covered so far in class, and ask if the
                methods you’re showing them look familiar. Don’t assume they’ve
                already learned anything.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What if I’m stuck?</strong>
                When in doubt, Google liberally. We promise you’re better at
                Googling than the student, and a few minutes is worth making
                sure you’re giving them accurate advice! If you really can’t
                figure it out, you can apologize and let them know you’re not
                sure.
